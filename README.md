# Music Genre Popularity by City (Work in Progress)

This is an early-stage project exploring **music genre popularity across major U.S. cities**. The goal is to uncover trends and preferences in different regions to help **artists, producers, and marketers** better understand where their music might resonate most.

While this project is still in its **early development phase**, it's something I'm actively working on and excited about. I'm building this with **data analysis, visualization, and geographic insights** in mind â€” and there's a lot of potential here as it grows.

Stay tuned! More updates and features are coming soon.

## Current Focus:
- Collecting and cleaning genre preference data by city
- Mapping genre trends geographically
- Exploring correlations between demographics and musical taste

## Future Ideas:
- City-specific music heatmaps
- Time-based trend tracking
- Recommendation tools for touring artists
